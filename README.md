# Machine learning algorithm decision

 ML project for Ironhack coding school.

In this Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/diamonds-datamad0120) we decide which ML algortihm predicts better the dataset given.

The goal is to find an algorithm that, given unknown feature variables, is able to predict better the price of a diamond as accurately as possible.

## Data ##

Dataset was formed by 10 columns: ID, price and 8 others describing diamonds physical properties such as carats anda sizes.
